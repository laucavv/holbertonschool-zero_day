# Emacs ðŸ“‘

**Emacs** is a popular text editor used mainly on Unix-based systems by programmers, scientists, engineers, students, and system administrators. Like other Unix text editors, Emacs provides typed commands and special key combinations that let you **add**, **delete**, **insert**, and otherwise manipulate words, letters, lines, and other units of text. Emacs is commonly used to enter the source statements for programs.
