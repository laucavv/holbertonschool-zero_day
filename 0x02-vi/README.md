# Vi ðŸš€

The default editor that comes with the **UNIX** operating system is called vi (visual editor).
unlike a word processor it offers no tools to visually determine what the printed document will look like. For this reason, it lacks options like centering or paragraph justification, but it allows you to **move**, **copy**, **delete** or **insert** characters with great versatility.
